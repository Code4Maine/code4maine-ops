Mission
-------
The Delivery Lead role in the Brigades is to know the Brigade's projects 
really well; their stack, their  status, and their  needs. Delivery Leads 
help their Brigade have more impact in their communities. They do that by 
setting up tools and processes to  facilitate project health and to shepard 
new and current members towards  projects where they can have the 
greatest impact. 

Goals
-----

1. By the end of Q4 the goal is to have a directory of projects and a 
   simple health metric established. 
2. By the end of Q4 I will also have a directory of members that lists 
   their strengths and contact details.
