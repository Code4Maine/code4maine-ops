Overview
--------

From Andrew Jawitz:

Since our founding in 2012, Code for Maine has been unique amongst other
Brigades in our focus on Open Source Hardware and "Civic Making". While much of
this came out of the original participants' expertise in hardware over
software, there is a compelling argument for civic making being especially
well-suited to the small communities we're likely to work with.

While Code for America has emerged as a powerhouse in the civic hacking world,
The Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science has emerged as a champion
of a more hands-on, citizen-science oriented method of organizing with
technology. Perhaps most significantly, they have perfected an effective means
of documenting open source hardware projects for which many Code for Maine
projects are already included at-http://publiclab.org/profile/ajawitz

I was recently invited to become part PublicLabs official organizer team which
would entail regular conference calls, check-ins etc... and managing the state
wiki at http://publiclab.org/wiki/maine. The wiki already includes a highly
detailed environmental project led by the Friends of Penobscot Bay, though
southern Maine has been equally active through organizations like Friends of
Casco Bay and the Harpswell Coastal Academy in a project to track the impacts
of aquatic invasive species.

Actions

TODO: Outline the actionable steps we as Code for Maine need to take to 
integrate with PublicLabs activities in Maine.
