Panel: Building a 21st Century Transporation Network

* Transporation is a land-use issue, not just movement
* Land isn't free, public pays for access to the road, and companies that make money need to trade equitibly


21st Century Tools
-------------------

* SimpliCity product, provide answers to common questions
* CityVoice app to solicite feedback with phone numbers and signs
* Understanding your users


Building Data Standards on Github
----------------------------------

* Mark Headd, Philip Ashlock, and Renata Maziarz
* Not a compliance exercise, about making data more accessible, not just for public, but also decision makers
* Better Data, Better Decisions, Better Government
* Machine read-able, platform independent
* Who are thes stakeholders?
* Maziarz: Be open by default
* Have a plan for responding to feedback
* Got criticism about lack of response to responses ... need handlers/people responsible
* Don't get cold feet


Community Building for Inclusivity and Diversity
----------------------------------

* Code for Philly shares their work building diversity
* Projects started with partners at the beginning
* With, Not For -- Laurenellen McCann
* "Everyone Can Be a Civic Hacker"
* Make it easy to engage
* Follow up and talk to newcomers
* Articulate and appreciate contributes
* As a coder, easy to acknowledge what's being contributed
* But academic researcher who asks the right question, or uncovers data sets, are less tangiible
* Balance the flexibility of hacking with structure
* Put a theme on hack nights
* Delivery is a strategy
* Process is a product - apps are never going to be the main thing we're giving you
* **Value proposition is building community and collective will to volunteer their time**
