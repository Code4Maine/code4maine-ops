Code 4 Maine 2014 Strategic Plan
================================

Lessons from our Inaugural Year
-------------------------------

Code for Maine was founded in 2012 as one of the original 8 groups participating in the brigade
program’s inaugural class. While most other brigades were centered around a single city, we
realized very early on that most of our participants were drawn from a broad region throughout
the state and that a regional effort would be necessary even if it made achievable goals much
more challenging. Likewise, we also understood that government partners in a region with the
oldest per-capita population would require significant education surrounding the benefits of
civic technology .

Our 2012-2013 Strategic Plan was therefore broadly focused on introducing the concept of
civic technology to public officials throughout the state, while also finding ways to augment
existing participatory traditions. In order to balance such broad goals with more achievable goals,
we also sought to partner with the cities of Biddeford and Bath, to demonstrate civic hacking in
action.

Far from being too ambitious, the results from our inaugural year could actually be interpreted
as showing our plan was not ambitious enough! Indeed, we found public officials eager to work
with us everywhere we presented, while our own membership blossomed to include a new
group of highly motivated and well organized civic hackers from the rural, northern portions of
the state.

Events including the National Day of Civic Hacking have proven to be an enormous success with
attendence in the city of Bangor alone matching that of far larger cities. Non-governmental
partners have included environmental organizations like the Friends of Casco Bay and local
libraries while local school districts and public charter school have eagerly embraced civic hacking
as part of the daytime curriculum.

These activities have been documented in detail in this Year in Review Slide Deck
Such unforeseen success, in concert with enormous growth in the parent program, has made it
clear that issues of capacity and organization will need to be addressed before anything more is
accomplished. Even in our original demonstration cities of Bath and Biddeford, the eagerness of
our city partners quickly surpassed our ability to organize talented hackers to meet their needs.
Whereas most of our original goals had been met by the end of 2013, it required almost the
whole of 2014 to reorganize into a stronger and more effective structure. Such a structure has
been built around the following core team members.

Annual Priorities
-----------------

We have selected the City of Bangor to serve as our main municipal partner
and area of focus this year. 

We will also be highlighting several ongoing campaigns from around the state
wherein a major  partnering organization is involved. 

As one of the “original 8” brigades, we would like to contribute our expertise 
to help newer  brigades, especially others from rural regions and small cities.
     
Likewise, we would be willing to participate in multi­regional campaigns with 
other brigades in the northeast region.

Strategy & Tactics
------------------

As a regional brigade covering multiple independent communities we recognize the importance 
of building unifying network for which a national brand like CfA is uniquely suited. Such a network 
has the potential to promote collaboration across different communities as a more efficient  
means of using scarce public resources.  However, our experience has also proven that 
lasting campaigns require local, face to face events to sustain them. 
 
Therefore we have devised a two part strategy to balance our role as a nexus of regional 
collaboration with the potential to make a lasting impact in public sector life. 

### Municipal Partner= City of Bangor

In order to most effectively leverage resources in one area we will be prioritizing our 
relationship with the City of Bangor as our primary municipal partner with which to build an 
institutional presence and serve as a template for future partnerships.  

The Bangor program will meet regularly, establish its own specific goals and utilize the majority 
of brigade resources.   

The program will function as a pilot for future municipal partnerships through a detailed review 
of successes and failures of which a criteria for future partnerships will be based.   
 
### Campaigns

To build on our role as a nexus of collaboration, we will also be highlighting scalable projects 
from around the state which may not be specific to a single city government but will include an 
anchor institution as a partner.  

Examples include: procurement reform, education hacks, community wireless/broadband access, 
food policy, volunteer logistics, environmental/citizen science, library/hackerspaces, transit, 
and emergency services.  Such projects are documented through the Code for Maine Dashboard  
and will be prioritized according to a criteria including group participation and partner 
commitment.  

A project pipeline beginning with a brainstorming hackpad and leading to a github repo, 
project wiki and top billing on the website will be managed by the Delivery Lead. 

Outcomes
--------

Thanks largely to the success of two consecutive NDoCH events, the Bangor program is at 
such an advanced stage as to consider an Institution role for the Brigade.  Thus, a successful 
outcome in Bangor would meet the criteria of an Institutional model as currently defined by 
Brigade Leadership.  From the perspective of Code for Maine, the Bangor Program will be a 
success if/when it yields useful guidelines on which future municipal partnerships can be built. 

Success for campaigns will be based on the willingness of project partners to commit their own 
resources, adoption by other brigades and/or evolution into a self­sustaining civic startup.  

In addition to organizing NDoCH for the third year in a row we also plan to take part in other 
national events such as Code Across America and if possibly would like to organize a new 
event/conference.
