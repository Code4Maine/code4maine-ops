Bangor Municipal Partnership Area
==================================

**Effective:** January 2016

The Bangor municipal area serves as a hub for much of Eastern Maine. The huge
geographical area and relatively low population density presents unique
challenges and opportunities. One of the biggest benefits of technology applied
to civic engagement is the lower barrier of entry, both in terms of time and
transporation issues.

Our goals for the BMP area for the 2016 hacking season are:

1. Establish monthly Brigade Meetups with at regular attendence by at least one
   municipal partner.
2. Build regular attendence for the Bangor Meetups to an average of 15 members
   per month
3. Enact an open-data policy for the City of Bangor, and have at least one
   municipal department trained on its use.
