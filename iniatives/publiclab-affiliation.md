Civic Making Overview
--------

From Andrew Jawitz:

  Many of the most successful projects that came out of our inaugeral year combined tools and techniques of the DIY/Maker Movement with that of civic hacking into an approach we call "Civic Making"
  While such an approach is gaining in popularity all over the world, there are compelling reasons why it is especially suited to low density regions like Maine. Hacking with Hardware alongside Software encourages a broader range of partipants to contribute a diversity of skills and experise.   
  Also, the “DIY” methods promoted by the Maker Movement allow small communities to interact with civic software created for larger cities on an appropriate scale. Examples of this approach include an effort to make vehicle tracking hardware more affordable for small cities called the [OpenVehicleTracker](www.openvehicletracker.org) and the [PaperMachine](https://github.com/Code4Maine/papermachine) which introduced techniques for building low-cost, DIY document scanners small town libraries, archives and municipal governments.
  
  As we grow to solidify our presence as a statewide institution, we will be taking steps to build on the successful "Civic Making" approach by collaborating closely with The [Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science](www.publiclab.org) on many of our statewide projects.
  
  While Code for America has emerged as a powerhouse in the civic hacking world,
PublicLab has emerged as a champion of a more hands-on, citizen-science oriented method of organizing with
technology. Perhaps most significantly, they have perfected an effective means of documenting open source hardware projects for which many Code for Maine projects are already included at-http://publiclab.org/profile/ajawitz

  By partnering with PublicLab on specific projects such as the [ongoing effort to stem the disastrous impact of aquatic invasive species](http://publiclab.org/notes/code4maine/05-08-2014/mobilizing-data-to-combat-the-evil-green-crab) we will bring expertise that helps government agencies, environmental NGOs and even local schools collect important data, both through the deployment of low-cost sensory techniques and by making larger open data sets more accessible through civic hacking.
  
  While a formal affiliation with PublicLab may not be necessary for the organization as a whole, Co-Captain, Andrew Jawitz will oversee the collaboration by serving on the Organizer Team within the PublicLab organization.  
  Another possible area of collaboration could be in utilizing the excellent [PublicLab "research note" network] (http://publiclab.org/research/) which has proven to be an effective means of documenting and soliciting help with open source hardware projects.
