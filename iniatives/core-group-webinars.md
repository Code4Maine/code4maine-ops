Core Team Webinars
==================

*This is a draft document*

Purpose
-------

Civic hacking is a great way to learn basic comp-sci/programming skills like 
working with APIs and using Git/Github. 

Our network can be a great resource for learning. 

Our core members should host their own webinars/Hangouts dedicated to a subject they are
knowledgeable in.

Actions
-------

A list of proposed webinars should be maintained somewhere online. Perhaps a
document in the git repo could keep track of them.

Webinar schedules should be developed such that no one core team member either
does too few or too many webinars.

Different formats should be developed, with some webinars being quick, evening
affairs, and others that might take place over a number of nights or maybe one
whole weekend day.

Folks should have a way to sign up for a webinar so that reminders get sent and
the organizer knows who to expect.
